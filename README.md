# INVO_RESNET
ResNet has emerged as a widely adopted backbone in the field of Computer Vision. This code introduces a novel approach to augment conventional Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classificationby incorporating involution layers, which exhibit inversecharacteristics to convolution layers. By integrating these involution layers into the ResNet architecture, a remarkable reduction of nearly 200 times in model parametersis achieved. Despite this substantial parameter reduction,the model’s accuracy only experiences a marginal drop of approximately 5% when compared to the originalResNet, both trained on standard datasets. Moreover, a comparative analysis with the lightweight MobileNetV2 model demonstrates the involution-based approach’s superior parameter efficiency. This research presents an efficient alternative to traditional CNNs, contributing to advancements in memory utilization and optimization of training costs.
